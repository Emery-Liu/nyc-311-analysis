# How to use (Cloud & Local)
## Cloud
Access: https://nyc-311-analysis.onrender.com/docs

## Local
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
   "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. Check your current directory by pwd, cd to the folder root directory.
   run "uvicorn app:app --reload"
3. Access http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to interact with SwaggerUI

# NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis
This project explores NYC 311 service request data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The goal is to understand:

- Which complaint types are most common
- Which NYC boroughs receive the most complaints
- How long different complaints take to resolve
- Which agencies handle requests most efficiently
- Where complaints are geographically concentrated

# Data Source
NYC Open Data: 311 Service Requests from 2020 to Present

Dataset page:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2020-to-Present/erm2-nwe9

This project uses a filtered sample dataset: 'data/raw/311_Service_Requests_20251231.csv'

# What I Learned
- **Web API Development**: Learned how to build RESTful APIs using **FastAPI** and serve them locally with **Uvicorn**.
- **Data Validation & Schema**: Learned to use **Pydantic's `BaseModel`** to define strict response models, enabling automatic data validation and Swagger UI documentation generation.
- **File Uploads**: Learned how to handle client file uploads using FastAPI's `UploadFile` and process in-memory file streams directly with Pandas.

# What I Practiced
- **API Endpoint Design**: Practiced designing logical API workflows, such as uploading data first, fetching JSON summaries, and triggering background plot generation.
- **Error Handling**: Practiced implementing robust exception handling in API routes using `HTTPException` to provide clear error messages to the client.
- **Data Visualization**: Practiced creating various types of charts (horizontal bars, pie charts, histograms, 2D heatmaps) using Matplotlib and saving them dynamically to a local directory.

# AI Assistance & Acknowledgements
This project leverages Advanced AI tools (like Codex/Cursor) to accelerate development, improve code quality, and troubleshoot infrastructure. Below is a breakdown of how AI was utilized:

- **Infrastructure & CI/CD** Troubleshooting Cloud Deployment | Resolved Render runtime crashes (`Exited with status 1`) by identifying needed dependencies
- **API Architecture** Feature Enhancement & DX | Guided the integration of FastAPI's `StaticFiles` mounting to turn server-side generated plots into accessible web URLs for end-users.
- **Code Refactoring** Error Handling | Implemented defensive programming patterns, such as utilizing `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` to prevent silent dynamic folder crashes in containerized environments.
